# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Context

This is a learning project for Next.js, React, JAMstack static sites, and GitHub Actions deployment to one-page hosting. The goal is to create a minimal project that demonstrates the complete workflow from development to deployment.

## Current Status

- This is a new project directory with only a study.md file
- The study.md file contains the learning objectives in Chinese:
  - Learn Next.js with React and JAMstack static sites
  - Implement GitHub Actions workflow for one-page hosting
  - Create a minimal project to demonstrate the full process
  - Document each step with git commits
  - Record questions and answers as learning materials

## Development Approach

This project follows a step-by-step learning approach:
1. Create a detailed work plan
2. Implement each step systematically
3. Use git to track progress and document the process
4. Record all questions and answers for future reference

## Technology Stack (to be implemented)

- Next.js with React
- JAMstack architecture
- Static site generation
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- One-page hosting deployment

## Working Guidelines

- This is a learning project, so explanations should be educational
- All steps should be documented clearly
- Git commits should be made frequently to track progress
- Questions and answers should be recorded in the documentation
- Focus on creating a minimal viable project that demonstrates the full workflow

# important:

- CLAUDE give the detail command and operation for each step. And the operation should be done by customer if not additional request. I will prompt to ask if the command has been executed successfully or not and then wait customer's input. And I will check if it's correct or not. and give next step.

- collect and write the report for each round talk with customer, record all the information for the finnaly restructure it.
